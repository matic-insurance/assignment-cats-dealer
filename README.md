## Cats Dealer 
### Hi, dude!
You are going to create simple service that allows finding the best pussycat - best price for customer location.

The are pussycat shops that have pricelists accessible via REST API. What your service will do is just get prices from each shop, compare them and suggest the best deal for a customer!

We created 2 fake test shops for you.
One can be accessed by this URL: 

https://nh7b1g9g23.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev/cats/json

It returns JSON data.

Another one is here:

https://nh7b1g9g23.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev/cats/xml

and returns XML

You may notice that both URLs point the same server, but in this task, please, consider them as absolutely different.

To help you understand the task, we asked our Trainee Ruby developer to create an MVP of "cats-dealer" - the project you have!

There is only one integration - with "JSON" pussycat shop.
Please run the project, see how it works, and explore the code.

You know, Trainee not always writes a good code. You probably agree if I say that the code is terrible! You definitely can do it better!

### So the task is:
#### 1. Refactor or rewrite the existing code. We wanna see a clean OO design, readable code, good test coverage.
#### 2. Implement "XML" integration, and improve business logic to find the best deal amongst two shops.

## Be strong and good luck!
